# Drake's Capstone Project

## Project name:
_HobbiTat_


## Description:
This is my capstone project for the June 2020 Savvy Coders Fullstack Bootcamp. _HobbiTat_ is a moneyless marketplace web app with mobile functionality that allows hobbyists to create profiles that showcase their skills and hobbies, and exchange them with other members of their community.

## Installation:
This SPA will be housed on [Netlify](https://hobbitat.netlify.app/) initially and will be functional on computer web browsers and mobile devices. After the Savvy Coders Full Stack Bootcamp, _HobbiTat_ will continue to be updated and may eventually be registered under a domain and be functional on IOS.

## Usage:
After opening _HobbiTat_, users create profiles after inputting some information, including: location, hobbies and skills they possess, photos and links to showcase their hobby, as well what intrests they want to explore on the app. After profiles are created, users may view profiles within their area in a slideshow, similar to the swiping process in dating apps like _Bumble_ and _Tinder_.

If the user wants to chat with another user whose skills spark interest, they may start a dialogue through chat functionality. If the chat leads to an agreed upon "Exchange", the two users may book dates in their calender for the "Exchange".


## Contributing:
Instructions on how to contribute to this project will be shared as they become available.


## Credits:
Credit is given to my fantastic TA in this Cohort, Vanessa Kratohvil. As well as the countless other instructors and peers who made the knowledge and creativity backing this project possible, most notably: Martin Carriel, Johan Bester, Lauren Lazarro, Asma Charef, and Brandon Burch. In addition, special thanks to all of the June 2020 Cohort at Savvy Coders for making this 13 weeks fun and enjoyable. Environment plays a huge role in creativity!
